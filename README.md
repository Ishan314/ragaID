# ragaID
RagaID is a simple python-based web application that can identify most Carnatic ragams by scale and name. It also provides some popular videos that include the ragam using YouTube API.


You can use the Raga Identification software at https://ragaid.pythonanywhere.com/


# Future updates

- Allowing Users to input short version names for ragams (Ex. Kalyani for Mechakalyani and Shankarabharanam for Dheerashankarabharanam).
- More information about the ragam.
- A recording of the scale and maybe an alapana for popular ragams in the database.
